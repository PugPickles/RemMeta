# RemMeta
Small python which automatically lists the `images in the "in" folder`, 

shows and removes the metadata and for safety after `saving the image in the "out" folder` shows the metadata of the new image.

## Create your own executable!
I recommend you to compile your own executable file.

You can do this easily with Pyinstaller

 * pip install pyinstaller
 
 
An simple example to create an exec (Windows/Linux same)

`pyinstaller -F run.py`
